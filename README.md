# My First cfd Code 

A simple MATLAB script that solves a **1D steady-state problem** using the **Jacobi finite difference method**.

---

 Description
 iterative numerical methods (Jacobi iteration) can be used to solve the Laplace equation in one dimension:

\[
\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = 0, \quad y(0) = 0, \; y(1) = 1
\]

The solution converges linearly to a straight line \( y = x \).
